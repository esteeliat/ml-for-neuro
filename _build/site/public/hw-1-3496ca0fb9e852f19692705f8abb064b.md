# Homework 1 - Probability

## Question 1: 

### a: Compute $P(X_1 = H)$
$P(X_1 = H) = (0.9 * 0.5) + (0.1 * 0.5) = 0.5$

### b: Compute $P(X_1 = H,\, X_2 = H)$. Are $X_1$ and $X_2$ independent?
$P(X_1 = H,\, X_2 = H) = [(0.9*0.9)*0.5] + [(0.1*0.1)*0.5] = 0.41$ <br>
They are not indepent - independence occurs when $P(X_1 = H,\, X_2 = H) = P(X_1= H) * P(X_2 = H)$ which does not hold here since the probabilities of heads on coin A and B differ

### c: Compute $P(X_2 = H \mid X_1 = H)$
$P(X_2 = H \mid X_1 = H) = \frac{P(X_2 = H \, X1 = H)}{P(X_1 = H)}$

### d: Using Bayes' rule, compute $P(Z = A \mid X_1 = H)$
$P(Z = A \mid X_1 = H) = \frac{P(X_1 = H \mid Z = A) * P(Z = A)}{ P(X_1 = H)} =\frac{ 0.9 * 0.5}{0.5} = 0.9$
